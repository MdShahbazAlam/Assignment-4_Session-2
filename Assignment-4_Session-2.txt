Perform the below string Operation:
* Replace the period character “.” Within the string with another character i.e. “-“minus sign.

Answer-
x <- c(“data.science.in.R”, “machine.learning.in.R”)
y<- gsub("[.]", "-", x)

2. x <- c(‘data.science.in.R’, ‘machine.learning.in.R’)
Perform the below string Operation:
* Append again with “-“minus sign character at the start of the each string and finally concatenate all the 
string within the vector to form a final single string and assigning it the object.

Answer-
x <- c("data.science.in.R", "machine.learning.in.R")
y <- gsub("[.]", "-", x)
a <- paste0("-", y)
z <- paste(a, collapse = "")
print(z)
